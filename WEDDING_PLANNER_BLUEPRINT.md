## 🎯 **THE BIG PICTURE VISION**

### What You're Building
**A comprehensive wedding planning platform that replaces expensive wedding planners and gives couples complete control over their 18-month planning journey.**

### Core Problem You're Solving
- **Couples get overwhelmed** with 150+ tasks spanning 18 months
- **Wedding planners are expensive** ($2000-$5000 in Kenya)
- **Details fall through cracks** leading to wedding day stress
- **No clear progress tracking** or delegation system
- **Budget management is chaotic** (private vs public budgets)

### Your Unique Value Proposition
1. **Complete Control**: Couples manage their own planning with intelligent guidance
2. **Cost Savings**: Eliminate need for expensive wedding planners
3. **Nothing Falls Through**: Every detail from your Excel sheets is tracked
4. **Stress-Free Experience**: Couples enjoy their wedding day instead of being exhausted
5. **Kenyan Context**: Built specifically for Kenyan wedding traditions and requirements
